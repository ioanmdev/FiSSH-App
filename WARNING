While compiling your own version of the FiSSH App may seem like a bright idea,
here are a few reasons why you should consider just using the release provided:

a) You can download it from F-Droid and Google Play
b) Help is provided (when I have free time, I make NO guarantee and provide NO warranty, read MIT LICENSE)

NOTE:
* IF YOUR COPY OF FiSSH APP IS NOT OBTAINED FROM F-Droid or Google Play, *
* YOU FORFEIT ALL HELP FROM ME! (SORRY) *
